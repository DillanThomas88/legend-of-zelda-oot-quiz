# Web APIs: Quiz - Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time

## About
Using Web APIs and using JavaScript at a beginner level trully made this project a excellent challenge! I spent my time equally between CSS and JavaScript amounting to a total of 8+ hours of trial an error. In this project I learned a few new things and applied previously learned techiques from previous projects. Along this journey I'm quite proud of figuring everything out on my own using documentation and critical thinking. What i'm most proud of is a Recursive function that I made to generate random wrong answers that are unique to the question as well as placing those wrong answers into random available 'slots' for the multiple choice. take a look at the function (script.js: line 260 - GenerateWrongAnswers()) The Correct answer is placed first, into a random slot. Also, this project includes a 'user' name entry after playing for the first time only, and updates automatically only when the user gets a new highscore. The following list consists of; newly learned syntax, and previously used syntax:
- Arrays
- Objects
- addeventListener()
- removeEventListener()
- getAttribute()
- setAttribute()
- element.children[]
- element.style
- array.push()
- array.splice()
- setInterval()
- clearInterval()
- localStorage.getItem()
- localStorage.setItem()
- localStorage.removeItem()
- JSON.stringify()
- JSON.parse()

Looking forward to applying these skill into deeper and more clomplex applications. 5 Star Project, would recommend for beginners in JavaScript!
